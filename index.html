      <p>Think about it, there must be a higher love</p>
      <p>Down in the heart or hidden in the stars above</p>
      <p>Without it, life is wasted time</p>
      <p>Look inside your heart, and I'll look inside mine</p>
      <p>Things look so bad everywhere</p>
      <p>In this whole world, what is fair?</p>
      <p>We walk the line and try to see</p>
      <p>Fallin' behind in what could be, oh</p>
      <p>Bring me a higher love</p>
      <p>Bring me a higher love, oh</p>
      <p>Bring me a higher love</p>
      <p>Where's that higher love I keep thinking of?</p>
      <p>That love, that love</p>
      <p>Bring me higher love, love</p>
      <p>That love, that love</p>
      <p>Bring me higher love, oh</p>
      <p>That love, that love</p>
      <p>Bring me higher love, love</p>
      <p>That love, that love</p>
      <p>Bring me a higher love</p>
      <p>That love, that love</p>
      <p>Bring me higher love, love</p>
      <p>That love, that love</p>
      <p>Bring me higher love, oh</p>
      <p>That love, that love</p>
      <p>Bring me higher love, love</p>
      <p>That love, that love</p>
      <p>Bring me a higher love</p>
      <p>Worlds are turnin', and we're just hanging on</p>
      <p>Facing our fear, and standin' out there alone</p>
      <p>A yearning, yeah, and it's real to me</p>
      <p>There must be someone who's feeling for me</p>
      <p>Things look so bad everywhere</p>
      <p>In this whole world, what is fair?</p>
      <p>We walk the line and try to see</p>
      <p>Fallin' behind in what could be, oh</p>
      <p>Bring me a higher love (oh my Lord)</p>
      <p>Bring me a higher love, oh (oh)</p>
      <p>Bring me a higher love (my Lord)<p>
      <p>It's that higher love I keep thinking of</p>
      <p>That love, that love</p>
      <p>Bring me higher love, love</p>
      <p>That love, that love</p>
<p>Bring me higher love, oh</p>
<p>That love, that love</p>
<p>Bring me higher love, love</p>
<p>That love, that love</p>
<p>Bring me a higher love</p>
<p>oh, bring me love</p>
<p>(Bring me a higher love, oh) we need a higher love</p>
<p>(Bring me a higher love) bring me, bring me, yeah</p>
<p>A higher love I keep thinking of, oh</p>
<p>That love, that love (bring me a higher love)</p>
<p>Bring me higher love, love</p>
<p>That love, that love (bring me a higher love)</p>
<p>Bring me higher love, oh</p>
<p>That love, that love (bring me a higher love)</p>
<p>Bring me higher love, love</p>
<p>A higher love I keep thinking of</p>
<p>Bring me a higher love (that love, that love)</p>
<p>(Bring me higher love, love)</p>
<p>Bring me a higher love (that love, that love)</p>
<p>(Bring me higher love) oh</p>
